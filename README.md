JobWayFinderBC is a web application used for searching jobs on a map and table. Using React and Firebase to display and store data. I display the jobs on the map. In this app, users can select which job they want (full-stack, data analysis, internship, and more), users can also select the location they want (Vancouver, Victoria, and more). This is an interactive web application with dynamic page.
